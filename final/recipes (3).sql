As much fun as we had experimenting with this\r\nmethod, we found the best way to test the pasta was, shockingly, by tasting it.\r\nIn Italian, \"al dente\" means \"to the tooth,\" meaning that it\'s still slightly firm\r\nto the bite. As your pasta cooks, periodically (and carefully) taste a piece of it.\r\nIf it\'s still too firm, let it cook a little longer.\r\n\r\n1 Prepare the ingredients:\r\nFill a medium pot with water; add a big pinch of salt and heat to boiling on\r\nhigh.
